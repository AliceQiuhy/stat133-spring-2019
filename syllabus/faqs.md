# Frequently Asked Questions

_Below are some of the questions I get asked everytime I teach Stat 133._

-----

### I am an undergrad student on the waitlist. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?

Stat 133 is a highly demanded course, with a waiting list continuously increasing every year. From my past experience, between 5-7% of enrolled students tend to drop the course in the first two weeks, thus allowing between 15 to 20 students in the waitlist to join the class.


### I am a concurrent student. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?

Concurrent students have the lowest priority. Depending on the size of the waitlist, you may or may not have a chance to join the class. In previous semesters (Spring and Fall 2018), about a dozen of concurrent students were successfully enrolled.


### I am a grad student on the waitlist. What are my chances of enrolling in the class?

If you are a grad student seriously interested in Stat 133, then you should try to schedule a meeting with me within the first two weeks of classes. While I cannot guarantee you a spot in the class, I would like to first determine if this course is a good fit for you. 


### I am a grad student officialy enrolled. Do you have a grading structure for grad students?

If you are a grad student enrolled in Stat 133, then you should schedule a meeting with me within the first 2-3 weeks of classes. I would like to know more about your program/project, and discuss the scope of the course with you. 


### I would like to switch lab sections with other student. Is this possible?

Unfortunately, this is NOT possible. You must attend the lab discussion 
you are officially registered in.


### What if I don't agree with all the course policies?

If there is one or more [policies](policies.md) you don't agree with, then 
please reconsider your enrollment in the course. I am assuming that all 
students completely agree with the course policies.


### Is this course a good fit if I don't have any programming experience?

Yes. We actually expect that most of you come without any coding experience.
It is nice to have some programming experience under your belt, which makes 
the learning curve less steep.


### Is this course a good fit if I've already taken at least one programming course?

You may find the majority of this course somewhat slow (and boring?) in terms 
of basics concepts such as data types, data structures, conditionals, loops, 
and functions. Please consider taking more advanced courses if what you are 
interested in is algorithms, computational statistics, data bases, or machine learning.


### Is this course a good fit if I don't have any data analysis experience?

Yes. We actually expect that most of you come without any data analysis experience. In this course you will be working with fairly simple real data sets, as well as with simulated data.


### Is this course a good fit if I don't intend to major in Statistics?

Stat 133 is one of the core courses of the [Statistics Major](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/programs/undergrad/major). The way I teach the course is having Statistics majors as my target audience. However, much of the content should be helpful for any student who has to analyze data.


### Is this course a good fit to become a data scientist?

Becoming a data scientist is not a sprint. It is a marathon. Like any other 
profession, it takes years of practice and learning. This course is just the beginning.


### What if I don't want to be a data scientist?

That's perfect too. You don't need to be a data scientist aspirant to take this course. Whether your plans are to become a consultant, life scientist, social scientist, journalist, or get some analytic skills, this course should be a good choice.


### Are we going to learn about machine learning methods?

No. This course is not about machine learning (or statistical learning) methods.
The Statistics department offers a dedicated course on this topic: 
__Stat 154: Modern Statistical Prediction and Machine Learning__.
There is also __CS 189: Introduction to Machine Learning__ offered through 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).


### Are we going to learn about data bases?

No. If you are interested in Databases you should consider 
__CS 186: Introduction to Database Systems__ offered through 
Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS).


### Are we going to learn about linear models?

No. The course for linear models is __Stat 151A: Linear Modeling, Theory and Applications__.


### Are we going to learn about Reproducible Research (RR)?

We are just going to scratch the surface. We will touch on dynamic documents and 
practices that are useful in RR, but the dedicated course for this topic is 
__Stat 159: Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science__.


### What is the best way to get help in this course?

Your best options are to go to [office hours](../staff.md) held by the course staff, or to ask questions on [Piazza](../piazza.md).


### How do you prepare for tests (midterm and final)?

This course requires many hours of practical work outside class and lab. It also requires reviewing all the material available in the [calendar of topics](../../README.md). Having said that, the midterm and final exams are a way to test your understanding of the various concepts presented in the course. The exams are also a way to test whether you really did all the practical work by yourself.

In theory, students who do an honest effort in completing all the assignments (e.g. writing commands, understanding commands, learning the syntax, etc) should not struggle answering the tests.

_Tip: try to explain how some piece of code works to your friend(s)._


### What do you recommend to succeed in this course?

This one is hard to answer, in part because it depends on your personal definition of "success". Simply put, I don't think there's a unique recipe for success. Instead, let me answer this question by telling you about the typical factors that may negatively affect your performance: missing lectures, missing labs, not submitting assignments, looking at the solutions of other students and "inadvertently" copy them, poor studying/working habits.


### Do we need to memorize all commands?

No. We don't expect that you memorize all commands. However, we do expect that 
you learn the most common types of functions: e.g. `library()`, `function()`, `help()`, etc. Likewise, we expect that you understand the "logic" and working principles of certain data objects, common programming structures, good practices, etc.


### Are we going to learn how to create an R package?

Yes, by popular demand we will continue teaching how to create a basic R package.


### Can we work in groups?

Yes, absolutely. We strongly encourage you to not work alone. Well, let me rephrase that. You should try to first work on your own (trial and error). Take notes of the things you don't understand. Then get with other people and discuss ideas, share tips (but not the entire solution). 


### Aren't you suppose to teach us?

Yes. But you don't learn programming by watching someone else program.
The same way that you don't learn to swim by watching someone else swimming.
You have to get into the pool, and do all the drills your instructor says.
This is a very hands-on course, and you will be required to do a great amount
of work on your own.


### Can I ask you to write me a Letter of Recommendation (LoR)?

Quick answer: No. However, I am happy to write you a letter of recommendation 
if I have known you for at least one year, and as long as we have developed 
a good collegial relationship (e.g. I know your name, I know your personal story, 
you've shown interest in my work).
Getting a "good grade" does not guarantee that I will write you a LoR. Conversely,
getting a "not so good grade" does not have to be an impediment to write you a LoR.


### I invited you to join my network in LinkedIn. Why haven't you accepted my invitation?

First: Don't take it personal. It's not you, it's me. Second: if you really 
want me to be part of your network, why don't you come see me in person? 
We can meet in OH, we can talk right before or after class. Or you can also
schedule a meeting at a different time. Let me know you better than just as 
a distant contact in a social media networking site.


### Do you have research projects open to undergrad students?

Lecturing takes most of my time and I don't have a lab. However, I'm always coming up with new ideas and experiments, and it's nice to have additional human resources to create something useful, interesting, open (and cool). If you are 
interested in volunteering and willing to learn a lot, come talk to me and 
let's see if we can join forces, and add our two cents to the world.
