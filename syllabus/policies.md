### Course Description

__Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data__ is an introductory course to computational data analysis with an emphasis on five major cornerstones:

- Data Manipulation (wrangling, reshaping, tidying)
- Data Visualization (focus on statistical charts)
- Programming Concepts (with emphasis on data analysis)
- Data Technologies (various sources/formats of data)
- Reporting Tools (via dynamic documents)

Because Stat 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Department, the underlying goal is to provide foundations for "computing with data" so that statistics-major students have the basic computational skills for subsequent upper division courses (e.g. Stat 150, 151A, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159). This involves teaching students how to:

- understand common data formats,
- use the computer extensively to conduct statistical analysis of data,
- use existing software rather than build routines from the ground up,
- understand how to visualize data and display statistical information,
- learn the basic principles for writing code,
- organize your workflow,
- focus on aspects of computing to conduct data analysis, NOT the 
computational aspects of statistical methods,
- use computational tools to carry out the data analysis cycle.



### Prerequisites / Review

This course does not have any prerequisites, although it would be nice if you have taken an introductory course in statistics (e.g. Stat 2, 20, 21, 131A). 

The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students (ideally majoring in Statistics) __who have NOT taken computer science courses__.You don't need previous programming experience, and you also don't need previous data analysis experience. However, students with some exposure to programming concepts, and data analysis tend to understand certain concepts better.

Students with some prior experience in either computational statistics or computing are welcome to enroll, though some parts of the course will feel extremely slow. Students who have taken computer science courses (e.g. CS C8, CS C100, CS 9H, CS 61a, CS 61b) should instead take a more advanced course.



### Expectations

We expect that, at the end of the course, you understand the general principles of data analysis projects, and the three stages of the _Data Analysis Cycle (DAC)_. This means that you can take a data set (in some common format), clean it, tidy it, get visualizations, write code, and report the results in a varied number of formats.

We don't expect you to become a jedi data scientist, an R ninja, or a super coder. That takes YEARS of practice, training, learning, and collaborating. Instead, we want you to become a skilled [padawan](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan) analyst (which, if interested, can be prepared to take the next steps of a data science marathon race).



### Methods of Instruction

We will be using a combination of materials such as slides, tutorials, reading assignments, open books, and chalk-and-talk.

The main computational tool will be the [computing and programming environment R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
The main workbench will be the IDE [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
You will also use a terminal emulator to work with command line.
You will also Git to version control some assignments, and submit them to Github.



### Disclaimer

The rest of this document details the policies that will be enforced in the Spring 2019 offering of this course. These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staff.
