### Course Description

__Stat 133: Concepts in Computing with Data__ is an introductory course to computational data analysis with an emphasis on five major cornerstones:

- :wrench: Data Manipulation (wrangling, reshaping, tidying)
- :bar_chart: Data Visualization (focus on statistical charts)
- :computer: Programming Concepts (with emphasis on data analysis)
- :rocket: Data Technologies (various sources/formats of data)
- :bookmark_tabs: Reporting Tools (via dynamic documents)

Because Stat 133 is one of the core courses of the Statistics Department, the underlying goal is to provide foundations for "computing with data" so that statistics-major students have the basic computational skills for subsequent upper division courses (e.g. Stat 150, 151A, 152, 153, 154, 155, 157, 158, 159). This involves teaching students how to:

- understand common data formats,
- use the computer extensively to conduct statistical analysis of data,
- understand how to visualize data and display statistical information,
- learn the basic principles for writing code,
- organize your workflow,
- focus on aspects of computing to conduct data analysis, NOT the 
computational aspects of statistical methods,
- use computational tools to carry out the data analysis cycle.



### Prerequisites / Review

This course does not have any prerequisites, although it would be nice if you have taken an introductory course in statistics (e.g. Stat 2, 20, 21, 131A). 

The curriculum and format is designed specifically for students (ideally majoring in Statistics) __who have NOT taken computer science courses__.You don't need previous programming experience, and you also don't need previous data analysis experience. However, students with some exposure to programming concepts, and data analysis tend to understand certain concepts better.

Students with some prior experience in either computational statistics or computing are welcome to enroll, though some parts of the course will feel extremely slow. Students who have taken computer science courses (e.g. CS C8, CS C100, CS 9H, CS 61a, CS 61b) should instead take a more advanced course.



### Expectations

We expect that, at the end of the course, you understand the general principles of data analysis projects, and the three stages of the _Data Analysis Cycle (DAC)_. This means that you can take a data set (in some common format), clean it, tidy it, get visualizations, write code, and report the results in a varied number of formats.

We don't expect you to become a jedi data scientist, an R ninja, or a super coder. That takes YEARS of practice, training, learning, and collaborating. Instead, we want you to become a skilled [padawan](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan) analyst (which, if interested, can be prepared to take the next steps of a data science marathon race).



### Methods of Instruction

We will be using a combination of materials such as slides, tutorials, computer labs, reading assignments, open books, and chalk-and-talk.

The main computational tool will be the [computing and programming environment R](https://www.r-project.org/). 
The main workbench will be the IDE [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
You will also use a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) to interact with your operating system.
Likewise, you will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to version control some assignments, and submit them to [Github](https://github.com/).



### Disclaimer

The rest of this document details the policies that will be enforced in the Spring 2019 offering of this course. These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgement of the course staff.


-----


### Learning Cooperatively

With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.



### Academic Honesty

Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not share your code or answers directly with other students. Doing so doesn't help them; it just sets them up for trouble on exams. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let us know ASAP. For more information please read the [Honor Code Guide for Syllabi](http://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/general/hc_guide_for_syllabi.pdf).

I (Gaston Sanchez) expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together---but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. __Cheating will not be tolerated__. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). If you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. 

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.



### Email Policy

- You should try to use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Stat 133 Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- __Do NOT expect me to reply right away__ (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- I prefer to have conversations in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.
- In case of cheating/plagiarism suspicion, I do not discuss things by email or bCourses.



### Special Accommodations

Students needing accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, should speak with me during the first two weeks of the semester, either after class or during office hours and see [http://dsp.berkeley.edu](http://dsp.berkeley.edu) to learn about Berkeleyâ€™s policy. If you are a DSP student, please contact me at least three weeks prior to a midterm or final so that we can work out acceptable accommodations via the DSP Office.

If you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar. Do not take the class if you are not available to take the midterm, final, and/or attend lab discussions. I won't be able to provide accommodations for a late exam. Since this is a hands-on programming-based class, I don't allow coaching staff proctoring.



### Incomplete Grade

Under emergency/special circumstances, students may petition me to receive an Incomplete grade. By University policy, for a student to get an Incomplete requires (i) that the student was performing __passing-level work__ until the time that (ii) something happened that---through no fault of the student---prevented the student from completing the coursework. If you take the final, you completed the course, even if you took it while ill, exhausted, mourning, etc. The time to talk to me about incomplete grades is BEFORE you take the final (several weeks before), when the situation that prevents you from finishing the course presents itself. Please clearly state your reasoning in your comments to me.

It is your responsibility to develop good time management skills, good studying habits, know your limits, and learn to ask for professional help.Life happens. Social, family, cultural, scholar, and individual circumstances can affect your performance (both positive and negatively). If you find yourself in a situation that raises concerns about passing the course, please come see me as soon as possible. 

__Above all, please do not wait till the end of the semester to share your concerns about passing the course because it will be too late by then.__



### Safe and Inclusive Environment

Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or GSI is responsible for the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a romantic or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.

Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this policy, you may contact the _Confidential Care Advocates_ on campus for support related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can bemade by calling (510) 642-1988.

The classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments for everyone. The _Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination_ (OPHD) is responsible for ensuring the University provides an environment for faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Questions or concerns? Call (510) 643-7985, email ask_ophd@berkeley.edu, or go to
